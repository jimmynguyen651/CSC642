**TIDBITS**

**Summary**
With all the options available to us, people will be indecisive on what they want to eat, or unsure if there is anything around they can eat in the first place. Tidbits is an app catered to individuals who want a simple solution to food-based decision-making. While simply picking what to eat may seem trivial, time spent mulling over it could be saved for productivity and relaxation.  In current times, correctly and swiftly making an accurate decision is more important than ever in the advent of COVID-19. The more energy needed to make a decision just for restaurant plans, the more it can be used for other things. Furthermore, work put into finding places that accommodate dietary restrictions or even allergies can be extensive and even exhausting for certain conditions.

Our website aims to provide everything a person needs to know about a restaurant at a cursory glance so they can make their choices as easily and quickly as possible. Versus Yelp, a popular online directory for local businesses, we hope to be a more straightforward approach in telling people when the restaurant operates and who it can accommodate. Yelp keeps it simple when it comes to searching for restaurants, however, the listings that are displayed don’t give enough information from just a quick glance. Tidbits hopes to make it easier for its users to see what restaurants will accommodate for from the listings of the search. Furthermore, we hope to provide safety by conveniently displaying how restaurants accommodate and tackle health issues, be it allergies or how they deal with COVID-19 safety standards. Versus Open Table, a service that allows users to make reservations online, we want to let users know in advance if there are reservations available even before one can even consider making plans, be it for overbooking or health reasons. Tidbits will even provide an option to place the user’s name on a waitlist if they intend to eat at a restaurant within the next hour. Versus TripAdvisor, a site where users read reviews of other users at different places so that the user can plan and enjoy the ideal trip, we want the users to have an easy experience when it comes to finding the next best restaurant. Tidbits will allow the user to be much more focused on searching for their next place to eat or take out food from by pointing out what each restaurant has to offer for their consumer while making the overall site less busy for the user. Overall, the goal of our app is to only need a few clicks and presses to see everything a user has to make a quick, yet informed choice. 

Our intended demographic will be anyone who uses apps to figure out anything related to food plans but specifically aims to help those who need more specifics. Be it people with health concerns, budgeting, or even figuring out if the place down the street actually serves tacos, our app should be welcoming to anyone. However, our primary goal would be aiding the people that need specific and important information with no hassle. While our app is simple in its concept, it aims to give a swift and easy experience to anyone who uses it. Between specific food-based information, closing times, and accommodations, Tidbits intends to set up your dinner plans conveniently and as fast as possible.

We hope to see you soon!
